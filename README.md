Coding Challenges - Word Count challenge by John Cricket, my version in Java

This program allows you to read a given file or input from the terminal according to the command and file name provided in the CLI. The commands being: 
```
-c (read bytes and show count)
-l (read lines and show count)
-w (read words and show count)
-m (read characters and show count)
default (if no command is given)
```

 Pardon me for my first README ever.
 
  I've had an absolute blast making this word count (with a lot of help from my good mate Nika (https://github.com/Ghurtchu)), and honestly it surely has trippled my knowledge on java as a former comsci student that finished the full-on java course in the premises.
  
  Incomparably more educative and difficult than the stuff they teach and throw at you in universities. Safe to also say that this is my first real project ever, with the university projects being theoretical to a degree that you can almost see a pattern of some fetish.
  
  It was also my first time with Functional Programming techniques(with anything other than imperative programming, really), what an absolute bliss. Thank you again to Nika for introducing me to it and thank you once more to Nika for introducing me to the great Venkat Subramaniam's educational presentations, and for the last time thank you to both of them for being such passionate developers and great teachers to teach me so much.
  
  I will probably be starting with the next challenge right away, with hopes of not giving up and learning even more on the way.
